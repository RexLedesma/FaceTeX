# FaceTeX [![Build Status][travis-image]][travis]
A tool that lets you communicate in LaTeX to your friends over Facebook chat. Simply add “Jaredbot Winowat” to your group chat and type `$yourLaTeXhere$` to get started.

##Configuration
If you want to do this with your own Facebook bot, please fork the repository and create a separate dummy account on Facebook. Replace the fields in `config.json` and run `node app.js`. After that you should be ready to go!
